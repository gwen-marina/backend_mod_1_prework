# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Gwendolyn R."
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
no_hogwarts = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
p no_hogwarts

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
def add_students
  students = 22 + 2
end
p add_students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
def subtract_students
  students = 22 - 2
end
p subtract_students

# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Gwendolyn"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 2

p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets
p "#{first_name} has #{number_of_pets} pets."

# IN WORDS:
# Explain.
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# for my name I used a string because that is what is most commonly used to return names
#for is hungry I used a boolean because it's basically asking if this is true or not, are you hungry? true/false
# number of pets is an interger because it's asking how many of something you have, which is usally answered with a number/integer


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Oliver"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 7

p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

p healthy_snacks
p junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
  #yes
